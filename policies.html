                        <ol class="decimal">
                            An absence is only considered excused when supported by valid documents. Below are the possible reasons and the corresponding guidelines to be satisfied before an absence can be considered valid. <br />&nbsp;
                            <li>
                                When a student gets sick, the following should be presented: <br />&nbsp;
                                <ul class="disc">
                                    <li>An excuse letter duly signed by the parents or guardian;<br />&nbsp;</li>
                                    <li>A medical certificate issued by the University doctor to support the excuse. <br />&nbsp;</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            Medical certificates not coming from the University doctor is unacceptable, except those coming from specialists (e.g. for eye problems, the certificate must come from an EENT specialist). <br />&nbsp;
                            <li>If the illness is minor and a medical certificate is not possible, the Guidance Counselor/Facilitator is given the task to determine the validity of the absence.<br />&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>When a student leaves for home to attend some personal/important matters, the student must secure an excuse letter signed by the parents/guardian and the Guidance Counselor stating the reason(s);<br />&nbsp;</li>

                            Note: Documents referred to in #1 - #3 of this section must be presented to the faculty concerned signed by the Guidance Counselor/Facilitator within the week the student returns to school, otherwise the absence automatically becomes unexcused.<br />&nbsp;
                            <li>
                                When a student is sent to represent the University, he/she should:<br />&nbsp;

                                    <li>secure in advance the excuse letter signed by the person in charge of the said event;<br />&nbsp;</li>
                                    <li>present the excuse letter signed by the Guidance Counselor/Facilitator to the faculty concerned before leaving the University.<br />&nbsp;</li>

                                When a student is required to appear before a public or private office, the student must: <br />&nbsp;

                                    <li>submit supporting document/s from the office that requires his/her presence;<br />&nbsp;</li>
                                    <li>present the excuse letter to the faculty concerned before his/her scheduled appearance in the said office.<br />&nbsp;</li>

                            <li>Students who may have mental or physical health issues must secure a psychiatric or health report from their psychiatrist or medical doctor.

                            <li>Any student caught cheating in a major examination (prelim, mid-term and finals) will automatically be given a grade of “F” on the course.

                            <li>Regarding prerequisite courses: If and when a student, due to an exceptional situation, has to take a prerequisite course simultaneously with a course requiring such a prerequisite, a failure in the prerequisite would mean no credit also for the course which required it, even if he/she passes the latter.<br />&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>Students of the College of Computer Studies (CCS) are required to attend all regular religious and academic convocations and assemblies. This policy also applies to all other special convocations/lectures/activities sponsored by the College and the University which are considered vital to the total development of the students.
